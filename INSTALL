INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS for ADNS

1. Read the security note below.

2. Standard GNU package build process:
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   # make install

Unfortunately, since this is a beta, there is no good documentation
yet.  For now, use the comments in the public header file adns.h.


You will find that adns requires a reasonably standard and up to date
system.

In particular, the build system assumes that you have ELF shared
libraries.  If you don't then please don't send me patches to support
your kind of shared libraries, and don't send me patches to use
libtool.  I'm not interested in supporting non-ELF shared libraries,
and I dislike libtool.  If you do not have ELF shared libraries then
please use the --disable-shared configure option.

The adnsresfilter utility uses `tsearch' from the C library (a la SVID
and X/Open).  If your C library doesn't have tsearch you will find
that configure arranges for adnsresfilter not to be built.  To rectify
this, install a C library containing tsearch, such as the GNU C
library.  It is best if tsearch uses an automatically-balancing tree
algorithm, like the glibc version does.  Simple binary trees may
perform badly.

You will probably find that GNU Make is required.


SECURITY AND PERFORMANCE - AN IMPORTANT NOTE

adns is not a full-service resolver.  It does no caching of responses
at all, and has no defence against bad nameservers or fake packets
which appear to come from your real nameservers.  It relies on the
full-service resolvers listed in resolv.conf to handle these tasks.

For secure and reasonable operation you MUST run a full-service
nameserver on the same system as your adns applications, or on the
same local, fully trusted network.  You MUST only list such
nameservers in the adns configuration (eg resolv.conf).

You MUST use a firewall or other means to block packets which appear
to come from these nameservers, but which were actually sent by other,
untrusted, entities.

Furthermore, adns is not DNSSEC-aware in this version; it doesn't
understand even how to ask a DNSSEC-aware nameserver to perform the
DNSSEC cryptographic signature checking.
