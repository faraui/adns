INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS for ADNS

   $ ./configure
   $ make
   # make install

Unfortunately, since this is a beta, there is no good documentation
yet.  For now, use the comments in the public header file adns.h.


You will find that adns requires a reasonably standard and up to date
system.

In particular, the build system assumes that you have ELF shared
libraries.  If you don't then please don't send me patches to support
your kind of shared libraries, and don't send me patches to use
libtool.  I'm not interested in supporting non-ELF shared libraries.
However, if you send me an appropriate patch I'd be willing to make it
easy or automatic to disable the ELF shared library arrangements.

The adnsresfilter utility uses `tsearch' from the C library (a la SVID
and X/Open).  If your C library doesn't have tsearch you will find
that configure arranges for adnsresfilter not to be built.  To rectify
this, install a C library containing tsearch, such as the GNU C
library.  It is best if tsearch uses an automatically-balancing tree
algorithm, like the glibc version does.  Simple binary trees may
perform badly.

You will probably find that GNU Make is required.
