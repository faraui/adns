                                   GNU adns
                                       
   Advanced, easy to use, asynchronous-capable DNS client library.
   
   adns is a resolver library for C (and C++) programs. In contrast with
   the existing interfaces, gethostbyname et al and libresolv, it has the
   following features:
     * It is reasonably easy to use for simple programs which just want
       to translate names to addresses, look up MX records, etc.
     * It can be used in an asynchronous, non-blocking, manner. Many
       queries can be handled simultaneously.
     * Responses are decoded automatically into a natural representation
       for a C program - there is no need to deal with DNS packet
       formats.
     * Sanity checking (eg, name syntax checking, reverse/forward
       correspondence, CNAME pointing to CNAME) is performed
       automatically.
     * Time-to-live, CNAME and other similar information is returned in
       an easy-to-use form, without getting in the way.
     * There is no global state in the library; resolver state is an
       opaque data structure which the client creates explicitly. A
       program can have several instances of the resolver.
     * Errors are reported to the application in a way that distinguishes
       the various causes of failure properly.
     * Understands conventional resolv.conf, but this can overridden by
       environment variables.
     * Flexibility. For example, the application can tell adns to: ignore
       environment variables (for setuid programs), disable sanity checks
       eg to return arbitrary data, override or ignore resolv.conf in
       favour of supplied configuration, etc.
     * Believed to be correct ! For example, will correctly back off to
       TCP in case of long replies or queries, or to other nameservers if
       several are available. It has sensible handling of bad responses
       etc.
       
Forthcoming:

   I hope that future versions may also have the following features:
     * The library should be useable by threads in a multithreaded
       program in a natural way. It should multiplex many threads'
       queries through a single query socket.
     * IPv6 support.
     * Some kind of awareness of DNSSEC.
     * Possibly some very limited caching behaviour.
       
   (Technical note: adns requires a real nameserver like [1]BIND or
   [2]Dents running on the same system or a nearby one, which must be
   willing to provide `recursive service'. I.e., adns is a `stub
   resolver'. All properly configured UN*X and GNU systems will already
   have such nameserver(s); they are usually listed in /etc/resolv.conf.)
   
Documentation

   I'm afraid there is no manual yet. However, competent C programmers
   should be able to use the library based on the commented [3]adns.h
   header file (from version 0.4).
   
Feedback

   I'd be pleased if you would let me know if you're using my library in
   your project, and what you think of it.

Mailinglists

   I have set up mailinglists adns-announce and adns-discuss. The
   announcements list is moderated and will contain only announcements of
   important bugs, new versions, &c. The bug reports address mentioned
   above is also a mailing list; feel free to subscribe to it.
   
   There are [4]archives and subscription web pages, or you can subscribe
   by sending mail containing the word `subscribe' to
   adns-announce-REQUEST@chiark.greenend.org.uk or
   adns-discuss-REQUEST@chiark.greenend.org.uk.
   
Download

   Available for download from [5]chiark.greenend.org.uk are:
     * The [6]current pre-release version as a gzipped tarfile.
     * [7]adns.h API header file with comments (currently there is no
       manual, sorry).
     * All versions released so far are also available via [8]anonymous
       FTP.
     * A mirror of my CVS repository is available via rsync from
       rsync.chiark.greenend.org.uk::ftp/users/ian/cvs-pub/adns (use FTP
       first to find your way around).
       
   adns is also available from the [9]GNU Project FTP servers and their
   [10]mirrors.
