Changes in adns 1.5, since adns 1.4, are:

 * This release provides full IPv6 support.  Applications can request
   AAAA records (containing IPv6 addresses) as well as, or instead of,
   A records (containing IPv4 addresses).  adns 1.5 can speak to
   nameservers over IPv6.

 * There is a fix to the one currently known bug in the resolver:
   previously, some harmless but wrong owner names for checked ptr
   queries would be accepted; now they are rejected with `Domain
   invalid for particular DNS query type'.

 * We fix a crashing bug in adnslogres.  (Debian#392102.)

 * There are also some build system and test suite improvements.

Compatibility:

  adns 1.5 is fully forwards API- and ABI-compatible with 1.4.

  adns 1.5 is not backwards ABI-compatible, in the sense that
  applications built against adns 1.5 but run with adns 1.4 may
  experience `Function not implemented' errors, or `symbol lookup
  error' due to undefined symbols.  But applications built against 1.4
  will not experience data corruption due to ABI mismatches.

  adns_r_addr queries (general `address' queries where the application
  does not specify the kind of address) used to only return AF_INET
  (IPv4) addresses.  To avoid surprising existing applications,
  AF_INET6 (IPv6) addresses will be returned only if the application
  explicitly states its support for handling a mixture of address
  families in the results from adns_r_addr.  In a future version of
  adns this will become the default.

  adnshost and the other command-line utilities are fully forward- and
  backward-compatible, except that in adns 1.5, adnshost will return
  IPv6 as well as IPv4 information if simply asked for `addresses'.
  Calling programs which did not ask for a specific address type ought
  to cope with this.
