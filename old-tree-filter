NB that NO VERSIONS of this file have been released, and I do not
intend to adopt this version.  The licence exceptions in this file
therefore DO NOT APPLY to any version of adns (unless the contrary is
clearly stated at some point in the future by me).

I.e. this file is just a draft.  That includes all the versions you
may find in version control systems (eg CVS or git), and particularly
those in work-in-progress or abandoned branches, or old revisions.
