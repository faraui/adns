adns (0.2) experimental; urgency=low

  Portability fixes for compilation on various platforms:
  * Include <sys/socket.h> and <netinet/in.h> in files with <arpa/inet.h>.
  * Don't use GCC union assignment feature (.rrs=0 => .rrs.untyped=0).
  * Explictly cast things to [const] struct sockaddr* in syscall args.
  * Check whether we need -lsocket.
  * Include <sys/times.h> in a few more files.
  * Include <unistd.h> and <sys/time.h> for select.
  * Look for inet_aton and inet_ntoa (in -lnsl and -lsocket).
  * LDLIBS removed from dependency lists (some makes don't support this).
  * An `ambiguous else' warning from some compilers in types.c is removed.

  Other changes:
  * Added COPYING (copy of the GPL).
  * Regression test failure output improved.
  * Missing targets in regress/Makefile.in added.
  * Regression test doesn't rely on value of fcntl flags eg O_NONBLOCK.
