adns (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  Incompatible changes:
  * Low adns_status values (below adns_s_max_tempfail) renumbered to make
    room for future locally-induced and locally-detected errors.
  * Event loop functions for use by select(2) renamed and tidied up.
  
  Features / improvements:
  * New adns_errabbrev() for getting status abbreviation strings.
  * regress/checkall prints summary list of failed tests, if any.
  * Event loop functions for poll(2), and some raw variants.
  * adnstest has ability to use poll(2), and user can set initflags.
  * checkall prints passed list as well as failed list, if any failed.
  * You can iterate over outstanding queries (but only once at a time).
  
  Bugfixes:
  * Non-RFC822 mailbox `domain' formatting now works, and clarified.
  * Rejection of bad characters in domains (without quoteok) works.
  * Clean up parents from adns->childw (otherwise would abort/segfault).
  * In adnstest, allocate enough space for, and terminate, query types.
  * In adnstest, don't print errno values as adns_status values.
 
  * Added TODO file.
  * Made adnstest.c test context pointers.

adns (0.2) experimental; urgency=low

  Portability fixes for compilation on various platforms:
  * Include <sys/socket.h> and <netinet/in.h> in files with <arpa/inet.h>.
  * Don't use GCC union assignment feature (.rrs=0 => .rrs.untyped=0).
  * Explictly cast things to [const] struct sockaddr* in syscall args.
  * Check whether we need -lsocket.
  * Include <sys/times.h> in a few more files.
  * Include <unistd.h> and <sys/time.h> for select.
  * Look for inet_aton and inet_ntoa (in -lnsl and -lsocket).
  * LDLIBS removed from dependency lists (some makes don't support this).
  * An `ambiguous else' warning from some compilers in types.c is removed.

  Other changes:
  * Added COPYING (copy of the GPL).
  * Regression test failure output improved.
  * Missing targets in regress/Makefile.in added.
  * Regression test doesn't rely on value of fcntl flags eg O_NONBLOCK.
