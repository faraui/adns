adns (0.2) experimental; urgency=low

  Portability fixes:
  * Include <sys/socket.h> and <netinet/in.h> in files with <arpa/inet.h>.
  * Don't use GCC union assignment feature (.rrs=0 => .rrs.untyped=0).
  * Explictly cast things to [const] struct sockaddr* in syscall args.
  * Check whether we need -lsocket.
  * Include <sys/times.h> in a few more files.
  * Include <unistd.h> and <sys/time.h> for select.
  * Look for inet_aton and inet_ntoa (in -lnsl and -lsocket).
